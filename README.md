# Master Course in DATA SCIENCE - by ProfessionAI
Hi everyone! \
Welcome to my repository dedicated to my steps during the **Master Course in Data Science** with **ProfessionAI**.\
This repository contains all the **final projects** I have delepoed, all by myself, as part of this course. \
In these projects I tried to make the most out of all the material and teachings provided by the course.\
I hope you  enjoy it! 

## Repository Structure
The course consists of 11 modules, each ending with a final project that applies the concepts learned to a practical, real-world use case.
This repository is structured as follows:
- Each module has its own folder, named with the module number and topic.
- Inside each folder, you can find the corresponding project.
